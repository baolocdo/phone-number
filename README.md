# phone-number

Go to `phone-number.js` and solve the TODO's. 

*NOTE*:
- To match a number in Javascript, you may want to use `[0-9]`
- To match non-digit characters, use `\D`
- To replace all substrings that match a regex pattern, use `replace()` instead of `replaceAll()` as Node may not have this method.

*HINT*:
- You may want to remove all of non-digit characters from the string to make it easier to test
